<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington. I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University, advised by Distinguished Professor Dimitris N. Metaxas. Before that, I received my ME Degree from Tsinghua University and BE Degree from North China Electric Power University, both in Beijing, China. I also spent four years working in China, including one-year wonderful research assistant experience in the Radiology Department of Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute. I have a solid technical background in [cardiac MRI](https://cardiacmri.com/tech-guide/imaging-sequences).

Research interests in the **ICML** group at UTA mainly focus on novel methods for **I**maging, **C**omputing, **M**odeling and ***L**earning. Current involved research projects are:
- Fast imaging: novel MRI pulse sequences.
- Computer vision and medical image computing: image segmentation, motion tracking, image registration, image generation, 3D shape modeling and 4D dynamic analysis.
- Cardiac modeling: simulation of the heart's function in both healthy and diseased states, including electrical conduction, mechanical contraction, and blood flow. 
- Low level learning tasks and inverse problems: image reconstruction, denosing and super resolution.

# üî• PhD Students Recruitment 
I am always looking for self-motivated and talent PhD students to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare applications. Students with a background in Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering (especially for MRI pulse sequences), Electrical Engineering, Automation, or related fields are welcome to drop me an email with your CV and publications (if any). Please note I may not be able to respond to every message due to limited time.
