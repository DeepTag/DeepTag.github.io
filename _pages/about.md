<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a final year PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University. My advisor is the distinguished professor Dimitris N. Metaxas. I received my B.E. degree from North China Electric Power University and M.E. degree from Tsinghua University, both in Beijing, China. I also spent three years working in China, including the one-year wonderful experience in the Radiology Department of Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute. I have a solid technical background in [Cardiac MRI](https://cardiacmri.com/tech-guide/imaging-sequences).  

My research interests mainly focus on computer vision, medical image analysis and medical imaging. Current research projects are: 
- Cardiac MR image analysis: motion estimation, image segmentation and strain analysis on cardiac cine MRI and [myocardial tagging MRI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19_KQq7y0uHBfTBLO72yykKKsjXfTkyXF/view).
- MRI pulse sequences and image reconstruction.
- 3D shape modeling and dynamic analysis.

# PhD Students Recruitment 
I am looking for multiple self-motivated PhD students to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI for healthcare applications. Students with a background in Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering (especially for MRI), Electrical Engineering, Automation, or related fields are welcome to drop me an email (meng.ye@rutgers.edu) with your CV and publications (if any). Please note I may not be able to respond to every message due to limited time.
